## Tour-Specific Questions

### Christ the Redeemer Tours

**Q: What's the difference between your Christ + Sugarloaf tours?**
A: We offer 4 variations:
- Unforgettable Rio (8h): Most complete, includes Christ, Sugarloaf, Santa Teresa, Selarón Steps, and more. Best for first-timers wanting everything.
- Rio Express 5h: Just Christ + Sugarloaf. Perfect for cruise passengers with limited time.
- Sunrise Sugarloaf (6h): 4am start for magical sunrise from Sugarloaf, then Christ. Best for photographers.
- Sunset Magic (6h): Golden hour at Christ, sunset from Sugarloaf. Best for romantic experiences.

**Q: Do you include skip-the-line tickets?**
A: Yes! All our tours include priority access to Sugarloaf Mountain cable car. For Christ the Redeemer, we use official channels and time visits strategically (early morning or late afternoon) to avoid peak crowds. This typically saves 1-2 hours vs buying tickets on-site.

**Q: What's the best time to visit Christ the Redeemer?**
A: Early morning (6:30-8am) for fewer crowds and cooler temperatures, or late afternoon (after 3pm) for golden hour photos and sunset views. We recommend our Sunrise Sugarloaf tour (4am start) for the absolute best experience with minimal crowds.

### Day Trip FAQs

**Q: Is Ilha Grande worth it for one day?**
A: Absolutely! With our private speedboat, you visit 5-7 pristine beaches in 5 hours on the water. We customize the route based on weather and your interests (snorkeling, swimming, secluded beaches). Much better than group tours that stick to 2-3 crowded spots.

**Q: Búzios or Ilha Grande - which should I choose?**
A: 
- Choose Búzios if you want: Charming beach town, restaurants, boutiques, 23 different beaches, Mediterranean vibe, easier access (2.5h drive).
- Choose Ilha Grande if you want: Untouched tropical paradise, jungle-covered island, turquoise waters, no cars, more adventurous, requires 3h drive + boat.
Both are amazing - depends on your style!

**Q: Can you pick us up from the cruise port?**
A: Yes! We specialize in cruise passengers. Our Rio Express 5h tour is designed specifically for cruise schedules. We pick you up at the terminal and guarantee return 1 hour before all-aboard time. We've never missed a ship departure in 12 years.

### Walking Tours FAQs

**Q: Are walking tours suitable for seniors or people with mobility issues?**
A: Our Historical Downtown and Little Africa tours involve 2-3 hours of walking with regular rest stops at cafés. Some hills in downtown Rio but moderate pace. Food Walking Tour is the easiest (mostly flat, with sitting breaks at each stop). We can customize pace and route for your needs.

**Q: What's included in the Food Walking Tour?**
A: 8-10 tastings of authentic Brazilian dishes and drinks: feijoada, pastel, açaí, pão de queijo, coxinha, caipirinha, Brazilian coffee, and more. Enough food to replace lunch. We visit local spots where Cariocas actually eat, not tourist traps.

### Practical FAQs

**Q: How do I pay for tours?**
A: We accept credit cards (Visa, Mastercard), PayPal, and bank transfer (USD or BRL). Payment is typically made after booking confirmation, with 50% deposit for tours over $500. Full refund if cancelled 24+ hours before tour.

**Q: What if it rains on my tour day?**
A: Rio weather is unpredictable but rain usually passes quickly. Christ the Redeemer and Sugarloaf are dramatic even in mist (photos are unique!). If forecast shows all-day heavy rain, we can reschedule free of charge or suggest indoor alternatives (Museum of Tomorrow, Confeitaria Colombo, etc).

**Q: Do you offer tours in Portuguese?**
A: Yes, all our guides are native Portuguese speakers (Cariocas) and also fluent in English and/or Spanish. We can do tours in any of these three languages.

**Q: Can you customize any tour?**
A: Absolutely! All our tours are private, so we adapt to your interests, pace, and preferences. Want to skip Santa Teresa and add a beach stop? Want longer photo breaks? Need to accommodate dietary restrictions? Just let us know when booking.

**Q: What about safety in Rio?**
A: Our guides are born-and-raised Cariocas who know which areas to visit and when. We use safe, licensed drivers and avoid problematic areas. The neighborhoods we visit (Zona Sul, Santa Teresa, Centro during day) are generally safe for tourists. We provide safety briefings and watch your belongings.
