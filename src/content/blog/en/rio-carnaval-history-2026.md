# The History of Rio Carnaval: How Chaos Became the Greatest Show on Earth

By Be Free Tours - January 27, 2026 - 9 min read

From colonial street games to samba, spectacle, and collective celebration

Rio Carnaval did not begin with feathers, towering floats, or carefully choreographed parades. Its origins are far older and far more chaotic. Understanding how Carnaval evolved helps explain why it remains one of Brazil's most powerful cultural expressions.

## Before samba: when Carnaval was pure street chaos

Carnaval arrived in Brazil during the colonial period through a Portuguese tradition known as entrudo, documented in Rio as early as the 17th century. During entrudo, people took to the streets throwing water, flour, eggs, and small wax balls filled with scented liquids at one another.

It was loud, disorganized, and often rough. Many members of the elite chose to stay away, while milder versions of the festivities took place from balconies and in private gatherings. By the mid-19th century, authorities officially banned entrudo, citing disorder and violence.

Carnaval, however, did not disappear. It evolved.

## Refinement, resistance, and the rise of popular Carnaval (19th century)

After the decline of entrudo, Rio's upper classes introduced European-inspired Carnaval balls, influenced by celebrations in Paris and Venice. Elegant costumes, masks, waltzes, and polkas filled private salons.

At the same time, working-class neighborhoods developed their own forms of celebration. Cordoes, ranchos, and percussion groups brought music and movement back to the streets. Groups known as the Ze Pereiras, famous for their powerful bass drums, helped establish the rhythmic foundation that would later give birth to samba.

This coexistence between refinement and popular expression shaped the unique character of Rio's Carnaval.

## Samba changes everything (early 20th century)

In 1917, the song "Pelo Telefone" was registered as the first officially recognized samba. But samba had already been thriving for years within Rio's Afro-Brazilian communities, particularly around Praca Onze and Cidade Nova.

More than a musical genre, samba represented memory, resistance, and identity. Its roots lie in African rhythms brought to Brazil by enslaved people, blended with local influences. Figures such as Tia Ciata played a crucial role by opening their homes to musicians at a time when samba was still marginalized.

In the Estacio neighborhood, samba evolved into a faster, more percussive rhythm, better suited for marching and large-scale parades. This style became the foundation of modern Carnaval.

## The first samba school (1928)

In 1928, musicians from Estacio founded Deixa Falar, widely regarded as Brazil's first samba school. The name came from a playful idea: if nearby institutions trained teachers, they would train "professors of samba."

The concept spread quickly. By the early 1930s, schools such as Mangueira and Portela were organizing structured parades. In 1932, Rio hosted its first official samba school competition, a tradition that continues to this day.

## Behind the scenes: how Carnaval is created

For travelers who want to go beyond the parade itself and understand how Carnaval is built throughout the year, there are experiences that offer a look behind the scenes.

One example is the Carnaval Experience, held at Cidade do Samba, the complex where major samba schools design and build their floats, costumes, and large-scale sculptures. Visitors learn about the creative process behind the parades, how themes are developed, and the craftsmanship involved in every detail.

The experience also includes an introduction to the history of samba and Carnaval, as well as interactive moments such as trying on authentic costumes and learning basic samba steps. It offers a clear and accessible way to appreciate the artistic and cultural scale of Carnaval, even outside the official parade days.

## From the streets to the stage: the Sambadrome (1984)

For decades, samba school parades took place along different avenues using temporary structures. That changed in 1984, when architect Oscar Niemeyer designed the Sambadrome, giving Carnaval a permanent home.

Built in record time, the Sambadrome provided samba schools with a stage worthy of their creativity. With grandstands, judging areas, and the iconic Apoteosis Square, Rio Carnaval became a global spectacle without losing its community roots.

## Carnaval today: competition and celebration

Today, Rio Carnaval combines organization and spontaneity.

- Special Group samba schools parade on official nights and are judged on music, harmony, choreography, costumes, and floats.
- Street blocos take over the city, with hundreds of groups spread across different neighborhoods, celebrating everything from traditional samba to contemporary styles.
- Every year, millions of people take part, locals and visitors alike.

## Why understanding Carnaval matters

Carnaval is not just a party. It is a living expression of Brazilian history, shaped by African heritage, popular creativity, and a strong sense of community.

When you understand the context, every drumbeat carries meaning and the experience becomes far more memorable.
