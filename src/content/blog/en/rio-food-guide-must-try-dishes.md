## Rio Food Guide: 13 Must-Try Dishes

Rio's food scene is as diverse as its beaches. After 12 years showing visitors around, these are the dishes you absolutely cannot miss - and where to find the best versions.

## 1. Feijoada: Brazil's National Dish

The ultimate Brazilian comfort food - black bean stew with pork, served with rice, farofa, orange slices, and collard greens.

Where to Try:

- Casa da Feijoada (Ipanema) - Traditional, tourist-friendly
- Bar do Mineiro (Santa Teresa) - Where locals go
- Academia da Cachaca (Leblon) - Classic spot with great sides

When: Traditionally served on Saturdays, but available daily at these spots.

## 2. Picanha & Churrasco: Brazilian Steakhouse Classics

The most prized cut in Brazilian churrasco - tender, juicy, perfectly grilled. Churrasco is the all-you-can-eat rodizio service that brings different meats to your table.

Where to Try (Rodizio):

- Assador (Flamengo) - Scenic views + great meat selection
- Churrascaria Palace (Copacabana) - Classic, consistent favorite
- Fogo de Chao (Botafogo) - Upscale experience

For a la carte (no rodizio): Giuseppe Grill (Leblon)

Pro Tip: Order it ao ponto (medium-rare) with chimichurri on the side.

## 3. Acai Bowl: Breakfast of Champions

Not the sweet smoothie bowl tourists know - Cariocas eat it savory with granola and banana, no honey.

Where to Try:

- Bibi Sucos (Ipanema)
- Maria Acai (Copacabana, Ipanema, and Leblon)

Order Like a Local: "Acai sem guarana, com banana e granola" (No added sugar!)

## 4. Pao de Queijo: Cheese Bread Heaven

Crispy outside, gooey inside, these gluten-free cheese puffs are addictive.

Where to Try:

- Casa do Pao de Queijo (Multiple locations)
- Talho Capixaba (Leblon)
- Any bakery - You can't go wrong

Best Time: Morning, fresh from the oven. Reheat at home in your Airbnb for breakfast!

## 5. Brigadeiro: Chocolate Truffle Perfection

Condensed milk, cocoa powder, butter, and chocolate sprinkles = pure joy.

Where to Try:

- Local bakeries - Fresh, classic versions
- Artisan chocolateries - Gourmet takes on the classic

## 6. Moqueca: Bahian Fish Stew

Coconut milk, palm oil, fish, peppers, and tomatoes = coastal perfection.

Where to Try:

- Satyricon (Ipanema) - Seafood-focused classic
- Aprazivel (Santa Teresa) - Upscale version

## 7. Pastel: Street Food King

Fried pastry pockets filled with... anything! Cheese, meat, shrimp, hearts of palm.

Where to Try:

- Feira de Sao Cristovao (Northeast Market) - Giant pasteis!
- Bar da Urca (Urca) - Classic snack with a view
- Belmonte (Ipanema)
- Any street fair (Friday-Sunday)

Local Combo: Pastel + sugarcane juice (caldo de cana) = perfect snack.

## 8. Coxinha: Teardrop-Shaped Joy

Shredded chicken in cream cheese, molded into a teardrop, breaded, and deep-fried.

Where to Try:

- Belmonte (Multiple locations) - Classic bar food
- Bracarense (Leblon) - Always crowded = always good
- Any boteco (neighborhood bar)

## 9. Tapioca: Gluten-Free Crepe

Made from cassava starch, filled sweet or savory. Beach breakfast staple.

Where to Try:

- Street fairs (Friday-Sunday) - Fresh off the griddle
- Sweet or Savory? Try cheese + coconut (doce de leite). Weird combo = amazing taste.

## 10. Caipirinha: Brazil's National Cocktail

Cachaca, lime, sugar, ice. Simple = dangerous.

Where to Try:

- Academia da Cachaca (Leblon/Ipanema) - 100+ cachaca options
- Bar Lagoa (Lagoa) - Giant caipirinhas since 1934
- Jobi (Leblon) - Where locals drink

Pro Tip: Try caipirinha de maracuja (passion fruit) - less acidic, more tropical.

## 11. Mate Gelado: Iced Mate Tea

Cariocas' alternative to iced coffee. Herbal, refreshing, energizing.

Where to Try:

- Beach vendors - Literally everywhere
- Supermercados - Buy the powder, make at home
- [Food Walking Tour](/en/private-tours/Rio Food Walking Tour: Authentic Brazilian Culinary Experience) - We'll show you how locals make it

Order: "Mate gelado, sem acucar" (no sugar) or "com limao" (with lemon).

## 12. Bolinho de Bacalhau: Codfish Fritters

Portuguese heritage meets Brazilian beach culture. Salty, crispy, perfect with beer.

Where to Try:

- Adega Perola (Centro) - Since 1958
- Cervantes (Copacabana) - Famous bar food
- Boteco Belmonte (Multiple locations)

## 13. Chope: Draft Beer Culture

Ice-cold draft beer in a chilled glass. Summer essential.

Where to Try:

- Belmonte - Best chope gelado (frozen beer)
- Bar Brasil (Lapa) - Classic downtown stop
- Any boteco - Beer is fresher where locals drink daily

Order: "Um chope bem gelado" (very cold draft beer) - size matters: tulipa (small) or canecao (large mug).

Bohemian hillside with great restaurants. Try Aprazivel or Bar do Mineiro.
