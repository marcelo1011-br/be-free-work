    text: "We only had one full day in Rio de Janeiro at the end of our cruise and wanted to see as much of the city as possible in our short time there. Flavio arranged an amazing tour of all the places we wanted to see and then some! He organized and planned everything so well that we were able to see and experience so much more of Rio than we expected. Flavio is very knowledgeable, friendly, and professional. We learned so much during our time with him. Flavio's English is also excellent! Language was an unexpected challenge in Brazil where few speak English and everything - signs, maps, menus - are in Portuguese, even at the airport! In our travels, we've found very basic English to be a common form of communication among world travelers especially in tourist areas, but there was quite a language barrier in Brazil. Flavio's articulate English was a tremendous help in overcoming that barrier. A very heartfelt thank you to Flavio for our wonderful experience in Rio de Janeiro.",

    text: "Gabrielle was an amazing tour guide and so knowledgeable. Johnny was our driver and they were both so welcoming! This private tour was perfect to cover off all the highlights we wanted to see. Christ the Redeemer, Selaron Steps and the Metropolitan Church. Unfortunately it was a slight rain on and off all day which did not allow us to see Sugarloaf Mountain. We made it to the first level but very clouded over so did not go to the top. Had a delicious traditional Brazilian lunch and finished off with a drive along the beaches from LeBron to Copacabana which we requested. An awesome day.",

    text: "Guide Flavio and driver Moises gave my wife and me an excellent introduction to Rio. Seeing Christ the Redeemer was undoubtedly the highlight for us, as it was the last of the Seven Wonders of the Modern World that we hadn't visited. As a lifelong resident of the city and a very experienced guide, Flavio had an intimate knowledge of the sites and was friendly and very flexible. While his English is not perfect, we didn't have a problem understanding his detailed explanations. Moises did an outstanding job navigating the crazy Carnaval traffic in Rio. I also want to note that Marcelo, the owner of the tour company, was very helpful throughout the process from initial booking until tour delivery, and he took care of every detail. All in all, we would definitely recommend this tour to anyone who wants to learn about this diverse and vibrant city.",

We had limited time for sightseeing and it was well worth it to take a private tour with someone so knowledgeable about the area. Rio is great, but getting outside the city allowed us to see some areas we wouldn't want to have missed while in Brazil. We fell in love with Palácio Quitandinha - an amazing place from a much more glamorous era - and had an excellent time visiting all that the city had to offer, including the Imperial Museum, the Crystal Palace, cathedral, the Santos Dumas House, and Bohemia Brewery. Oh, and did I mention the chocolate shop? It was a very memorable trip - if you get the chance to go with Marcelo, definitely GO!",
