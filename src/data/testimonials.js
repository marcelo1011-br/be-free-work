We visited Sugarloaf mountain, Christ the Redeemer and the Selaron Steps and we also had time to visit Copacabana and have lunch with Gabrielle at a place she recommended. All in all, a great private tour, definitely worth the price!",

    text: "This was an amazing tour! Christ the Redeemer and the view of Rio was breathtaking! Sugarloaf Mountain and the Selaron steps were also fantastic! Our guide Higor also made a special quick stop at the Copacabana so we could see it. Higor made this so memorable for us. He went out of his way to make recommendations so we would get the most of our tour. I've been on many tours, but Higor truly is one of the best there is. If you are in Rio, take this tour!!! You'll leave happy and fulfilled.",

    text: "Guide Flavio and driver Moises gave my wife and me an excellent introduction to Rio. Seeing Christ the Redeemer was undoubtedly the highlight for us, as it was the last of the Seven Wonders of the Modern World that we hadn't visited. As a lifelong resident of the city and a very experienced guide, Flavio had an intimate knowledge of the sites and was friendly and very flexible. While his English is not perfect, we didn't have a problem understanding his detailed explanations. Moises did an outstanding job navigating the crazy Carnaval traffic in Rio. I also want to note that Marcelo, the owner of the tour company, was very helpful throughout the process from initial booking until tour delivery, and he took care of every detail. All in all, we would definitely recommend this tour to anyone who wants to learn about this diverse and vibrant city.",

    text: "We had a great time on this tour! Our driver and guide, Marcelo, is the BEST - very personable, friendly, and professional ...seriously, we can not say enough nice things about him! We had limited time for sightseeing and it was well worth it to take a private tour with someone so knowledgeable about the area. Rio is great, but getting outside the city allowed us to see some areas we wouldn't want to have missed while in Brazil. We fell in love with Palácio Quitandinha - an amazing place from a much more glamorous era - and had an excellent time visiting all that the city had to offer, including the Imperial Museum, the Crystal Palace, cathedral, the Santos Dumas House, and Bohemia Brewery. Oh, and did I mention the chocolate shop? It was a very memorable trip - if you get the chance to go with Marcelo, definitely GO!",

When we mentioned that we would love to have some Brazilian coffee to take home as a souvenir, she incorporated a stop in the tour to accommodate! She was so knowledgeable about all of the places we saw. There isn't a better way to see Petropolis and all of its sights!",
